This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in COBOL loops. The bug.cob file contains the erroneous code, while bugSolution.cob provides the corrected version.  The error arises from an incorrect loop termination condition, leading to one record being missed. The solution adjusts the condition to accurately process all records.
